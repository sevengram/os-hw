> How to build and run?
Make sure you have installed cmake, then just run build_run.sh


> Start point
I took a computer system course (similar to CSCI2400) in my undergraduate program. I wrote a tiny shell at that time, which is a lab of CSAPP. It provides a simple shell framework with job control. I start this assignment based on these old codes.


> Built-in commands
exit - exit the shell
quit - exit the shell
cd - change working dir
jobs - list the running and stopped background jobs
bg <job> - Change a stopped background job to a running background job
fg <job> - Change a stopped or running background job to a running in the foreground
fc -<n1> -<n2> - Re-execute the last set of commands in the range from the last n1th command to the last n2th command

(Unique feature)
addb <bookmark> <dir> - add dir as bookmark (dir can be relative, and will be saved as absolute position)
lsb - list saved bookmarks
rmb <bookmark> - remove a bookmark
cdb <bookmark> - change working dir to the bookmark


> Features
1. Foreground and background job controls

2. I/O redirection

3. Pipe
- Support multiple pipes
- Support pipe with I/O redirection

$ ls -l | grep rw | sort
$ ls -l | grep rw > 1.txt
$ ls -l > 1.txt | grep rw (output nothing to stdout)

4. Interactive and batch modes

5. Process substitution
- Support both >() and <()
- Support multiple and nested substitution
- Support substitution with pipe and I/O redirection

$ cat <(ls) <(ls)
$ ls > >(cat)
$ cat <(cat <(ls) <(ls))
$ cat <(ls -l | grep rw)
$ cat <(ls -l > 1.txt) (output nothing to stdout)
$ cat <(ls -l) > 1.txt

6. Re-execute the last set of commands ('fc' command)

7. (Unique feature) Bookmark
addb <bookmark> <dir> - add dir as bookmark (dir can be relative, and will be saved as absolute position)
lsb - list saved bookmarks
cdb <bookmark> - change working dir to the bookmark
rmb <bookmark> - remove a bookmark

When user exiting the shell, bookmarks are recorded in a file (~/.tshinfo) for next time usage.

/home/user $ addb music ./mp3
/home/user $ lsb
music => /home/user/mp3
/home/user $ cdb music
/home/user/music $ rmb music
