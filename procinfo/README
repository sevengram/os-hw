Problem 2:

I use approach 2 (ioctl approach) to implement.

typedef struct procinfo_arg {
    pid_t pid;
    procinfo_t *info;
} procinfo_arg_t;

This structure is used to pass the arguments to the ioctl function of the device driver module.
The process information got from kernel is passed back to the user space by copy_to_user.

main.c is used to test the device and print the result.
Run test.sh to launch the test and see the output.
